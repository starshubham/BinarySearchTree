# Binary Search Tree
UC1 - Ability to create a BST by adding 56 and then adding 30 & 70 - Use INode to create My Binary Node 
- Note the key has to extend comparable to compare and determine left or right node
- First add 56 as root node so 30 will be added to left and 70 to right

UC2 - Ability to create the binary tree shown in the figure
- Check if all are added with using size method in Binary Tree

UC3 - Ability to search 63 in the Binary Tree
- Implement Search method and recursively search left or right nodes to find 63
